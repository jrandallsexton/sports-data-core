          <strong>🚀 Capitalizing on Early-Season Volatility:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The first few weeks of the season are chaotic — and that's good news
          for sharp pickers. Power rankings are still stabilizing, and public
          perception often lags behind reality. This is your window to find
          value where others see noise.

          Avoid overreacting to Week 1 blowouts. Teams often iron out mistakes
          quickly. Focus on consistency at quarterback, coaching continuity, and
          whether a team played above or below its expected efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t forget to watch the spread. Early-season lines are often set
          based on preseason expectations, not current performance. That means
          smart underdog picks can lead to early leaderboard jumps in your
          pick’em group.

          SportDeets AI is trained to spot misleading Week 1 results — check the
          “Preview” tab to see which games the models flag as potential
          overreactions.

          🧠 Pro Tip: In Weeks 1–3, lean into volatility — you only get a few
          chances each season to outsmart the field this early.
