      <h2>The Huddle</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>sportDeets</strong>. We trash talk here. It's fun.
        Get over it.
      </p>

      <h2>‚úÖ What Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Create and join leagues</li>
        <li>Submit your picks (Straight Up or ATS)</li>
        <li>
          AI-powered matchup previews{" "}
          <em>(hint: look between the pick buttons)</em>
        </li>
        <li>Group-based smack talk threads aka: Messageboards</li>
        <li>
          Picks can be submitted individually instead of all at once{" "}
          <em>(ahem, you know who you are, someWebsite!)</em>
        </li>
        <li>App is mostly mobile-friendly. If you find something broken, please report it!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è What‚Äôs Rough</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The ability to assign confidence points won't be around until Week 2.
          Maybe.
        </li>
        <li>
          The first week‚Äôs scoring will be run manually ‚Äî don‚Äôt panic when your
          picks aren‚Äôt scored the second the clock hits zero.
        </li>
        <li>No email or SMS reminders (yet)</li>
        <li>
          AI previews are still evolving. They‚Äôll get better as I source more
          historical data ‚Äî and as this season unfolds.
        </li>
        <li>
          AI picks are included in every group unless people complain about it.
        </li>
        <li>You might break something ‚Äî that‚Äôs just part of the deal.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>üöß What‚Äôs Coming</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Importing picks from other groups</li>
        <li>Auto-importing picks from other groups (in case you forget)</li>
        <li>Weekly recaps and reminders</li>
        <li>In-App notifications for games in your league(s)</li>
        <li>Badges.  A trophy like you never knew you wanted. <em>(you can preview them under Settings)</em></li>
        <li>Game Center view for live updates</li>
        <li>No mobile app yet (2026 maybe?)</li>
        <li>Additional sports (NFL, MLB, NBA, etc.) once this foundation is solid</li>
        <li>More features once people start complaining</li>
      </ul>
