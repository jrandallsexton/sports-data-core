          As we reach the midpoint of the season, it's important to reevaluate
          your pick strategy. Early trends are helpful, but teams evolve.
          Injuries, morale, and home-field advantages start playing bigger
          roles. Don't just trust team records ‚Äî look deeper into strength of
          schedule and player news.

          One of the best ways to gain an edge is by identifying overhyped
          favorites. Upsets tend to cluster late in the season when playoff
          pressure builds. Look for games where the spread seems too generous,
          and consider a calculated risk on the underdog.
